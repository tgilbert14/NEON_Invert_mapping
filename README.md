# NEON_Invert_mapping
Script to pull Invert collections for selected NEON site (SYCA) and mutate data to captures by sample site over time, will then find lat/long locations and make leaflet map with corresponding captures over the top to view most captured species. Exact locations not known so are alterd to other known SYCA lat/long points to help spead out capture view.
